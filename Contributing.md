<h2> Hola contributors! </h2>

First, I would like to mention that the installation and setup of the project is indeed very easy, and the long steps mentioned are detailed so that a uset can easily understand the setup. Also, bem methodology is used for the naming of css classes. 

<h3> How to contribute </h3>
- Check the issues and see if an issue to not assigned to anybody, and comment on the issue requesting it to be assigned to you. 
- If all the issues are assigned check if an assignee has not updated the progress on the issue for more than 5 days. If you find such issue, request for assigned it to be you. 
- If it's neither first nor second case, go to the deployed website and play around with its functionalities. If you find any bug, or have an suggestion to improvise the functionalities or have a new feature to add, create a issue for the same.
- Our chat application is powered by Getsream, and its trial is one month long, (mine expires on 27th Oct, so try to contribute before that) and twilio is used for sms notifications. 
- If you find any difficulty in understanding how certain things are working, you can check [getstream](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/) and [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/docs) documentation.
